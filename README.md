# Ray Tracing in One Weekend in Go

![Output from ray tracing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shovon/raytracing-golang/master/output.png?token=AACFPIHYIGQCGTFSHWRBMHS5M5RKM)

This is a ray tracing implementation in Go.

All implementation was translated from the minibook *[Ray Tracing In One Weekend](https://www.amazon.ca/Ray-Tracing-Weekend-Minibooks-Book-ebook/dp/B01B5AODD8)*. The book opted for C++, but I figured a good way to learn both Go and ray tracing would be to go through the minibook, and go through the steps, without copying and pasting. Writing in Go is a good way to motivate me to read through the book.
